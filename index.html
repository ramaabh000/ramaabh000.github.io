<p>I would like to visit a place that is a sunny climate to escape the cold of <strong><font color="#FF9900">Minnesota</font></strong>, so I would choose Florida because they have tons of beaches to visit. I would personally think that this is a relaxing place, so that is the main reason I would just want to visit Florida for some time. I have also never been to the Florida Keys, so that also may be a thing that I will visit just to see a new thing as I heard that it is soon to go underwater from global warming. </p>

<p>One thing I like to do is going biking &#X1F6B2 becuase it is an outdoor exercise where it is hard to overexert yourself, and I find it calming. Another thing I like to do is really almost any form of entertainment, like board games, TV, or reading a book because they are good ways to pass time quickly. </p>
